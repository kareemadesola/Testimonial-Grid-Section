## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### HTML

- How to use BEM naming convention for classes
- Adding Favicon to my website

#### CSS

- Using media queries for different screen sizes
- Using HSL color code format
- Applied newly learnt CSS properties such as `grid-template-columns`, `grid-column`, `grid-row`, `nth-of-type` selector
- Reinforced already learnt CSS properties

### Continued development

- Use more of CSS grids in future projects to reinforce my understanding
- Use CSS functions like `calc()` in future projects
